RingCentral Web Apps Sync
=========================

This library can be used to synchronize parent frame and the IFRAME:

- URL of parent frame and `IFRAME`
- `IFRAME` size will be set according to it's content
- CustomEvents on the `IFRAME` DOM node will be transmitted to and from the page inside `IFRAME`
