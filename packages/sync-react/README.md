RingCentral Web Apps Sync React
===============================

This library can be used to synchronize parent frame and the IFRAME.

It is a small React wrapper for the main sync library.

It also normalizes the React Router history object as there are discrepancies between versions 3 and 4+.

**This library can be used without Web Apps.**
